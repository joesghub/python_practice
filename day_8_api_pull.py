# Write a Python script that fetches data from a public API (e.g., a random joke API) and prints the result. 

# Output Example:

# Fetching a joke...
# Here's a joke: Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts.

########## VERSION 1: VIEWING RESPONSE ###########

# Print the Raw JSON Response
# Before assuming anything, it's good practice to print the response to see its structure:
# response = requests.get(url)
# print(response.json())  # Print raw JSON output

# import requests
# import json

# def get_word():
#     # Define the API endpoint URL
#     url = 'https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/service'

#     try:
#         # Make a GET request to the API endpoint using requests.get()
#         response = requests.get(url)
#         word = response.json()
#         print(word)
#     finally:
#         print("Well done!")

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     get_word()

########## VERSION 2: FORMATTING RESPONSE FOR READABILITY ###########

# import requests
# import json

# def get_word():
#     # Define the API endpoint URL
#     url = 'https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/cheer'

#     try:
#         # Make a GET request to the API endpoint using requests.get()
#         response = requests.get(url)
#         word = response.json()

#         if isinstance(word, list):  # Check if the response is a list
#             word = word[0]  # Get the first dictionary inside the list

#         print(word.keys())
#         print(json.dumps(word, indent=4))  # Pretty-print JSON
#     finally:
#         print("Well done!")

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     get_word()

# __name__: This is a built-in Python variable that holds the name of the current module.
# When you run the script directly, __name__ is set to "__main__", so the code inside this block runs.
# When you import the script as a module, __name__ is set to the scriptâ€™s filename (not "__main__"), so the code inside this block does not run automatically.
# Why Is This Useful?
# It prevents functions from executing when you import the script into another Python file.
# It allows the script to be reused as a module in other programs.

########## VERSION 3: IDEAL FORMATTING BASED ON STRUCTURE EXPLORATION ###########
